    "Abstract": "Moroccan Darija is a vernacular spoken by over 30 million people primarily in\nMorocco. Despite a high number of speakers, it remains a low-resource language.\nIn this paper, we introduce GOUD.MA: a dataset of over 158k news articles for automatic summarization in code-switched Moroccan Darija. We analyze the dataset\nand find that it requires a high level of abstractive reasoning. We fine-tune the\nArabic-language BERT (AraBERT), and the language models for the Moroccan\n(DarijaBERT), and Algerian (DziriBERT) national vernaculars for summarization\non GOUD.MA. The results show that GOUD.MA is a challenging summarization\nbenchmark dataset. We release our dataset publicly in an effort to encourage the\ndiversity of evaluation tasks to improve language modeling in Moroccan Darija.",
