    "Abstract": "In this article we present Curras, the first morphologically annotated\ncorpus of the Palestinian Arabic dialect. Palestinian Arabic is one of the many\nprimarily spoken dialects of the Arabic language. Arabic dialects are generally\nunder-resourced compared to Modern Standard Arabic, the primarily written and\nofficial form of Arabic. We start in the article with a background description that\nsituates Palestinian Arabic linguistically and historically and compares it to Modern\nStandard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic in terms of phonological, morphological,\northographic, and lexical variations. We then describe the methodology we developed to collect Palestinian Arabic text to guarantee a variety of representative\ndomains and genres. We also discuss the annotation process we used, which\nextended previous efforts for annotation guideline development, and utilized\nexisting automatic annotation solutions for Standard Arabic and Egyptian Arabic.\nThe annotation guidelines and annotation meta-data are described in detail. The\nCurras Palestinian Arabic corpus consists of more than 56 K tokens, which are annotated with rich morphological and lexical features. The inter-annotator agreement results indicate a high degree of consistency.",
