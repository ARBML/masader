    "Description": "This dataset contains multi-font Arabic printed text images used for text segmentation and OCR tasks. It involves different fonts and styles of Arabic script. The data is segmented using a hybrid method for character recognition, focusing on features like text skew correction, line, word, and character segmentation, and feature extraction for Arabic characters.",

    "Abstract": "This paper introduces a hybrid method for Arabic multi-font text segmentation and reference corpus construction. It focuses on segmenting Arabic text in multiple fonts for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), leveraging techniques such as image skew correction, line, word, and character segmentation. The paper also discusses feature extraction for character recognition, including identifying character dots and concavities.",
