    "Abstract": "We describe here a Web inventory named\nWIT3\nthat offers access to a collection of\ntranscribed and translated talks. The core\nof WIT3\nis the TED Talks corpus, that\nbasically redistributes the original content\npublished by the TED Conference website (http://www.ted.com). Since 2007,\nthe TED Conference, based in California,\nhas been posting all video recordings of\nits talks together with subtitles in English\nand their translations in more than 80 languages. Aside from its cultural and social relevance, this content, which is published under the Creative Commons BYNC-ND license, also represents a precious\nlanguage resource for the machine translation research community, thanks to its size,\nvariety of topics, and covered languages.\nThis effort repurposes the original content\nin a way which is more convenient for machine translation researchers.",
