    "Abstract": "With the growing adoption of Retrieval-\nAugmented Generation (RAG) in document\nprocessing, robust text recognition has become\nincreasingly critical for knowledge extraction.\nWhile OCR (Optical Character Recognition)\nfor English and other languages benefits from\nlarge datasets and well-established benchmarks,\nArabic OCR faces unique challenges due to its\ncursive script, right-to-left text flow, and com-\nplex typographic and calligraphic features. We\npresent KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Ara-\nbic OCR benchmark that fills the gaps in cur-\nrent evaluation systems. Our benchmark com-\nprises 8,809 samples across 9 major domains\nand 36 subdomains, encompassing diverse doc-\nument types including handwritten text, struc-\ntured tables, and specialized coverage of 21\nchart types for business intelligence. Our find-\nings show that modern vision language mod-\nels (such as GPT-4o, Gemini, and Qwen) out-\nperform traditional OCR approaches (such as\nEasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and Surya) by an av-\nerage of 60% in the character error rate (CER).\nFurthermore, we highlight significant limita-\ntions of current Arabic OCR models, particu-\nlarly in PDF-to-Markdown conversion, where\nthe best model Gemini-2.0-Flash achieves only\n65% accuracy. This underscores the challenges\nof accurately recognizing Arabic text, includ-\ning issues with complex fonts, numeral recog-\nnition errors, word elongation, and table struc-\nture detection. This work establishes a rigorous\nevaluation framework that can drive improve-\nments in Arabic document analysis methods\nand bridge the performance gap with English\nOCR technologies.",
