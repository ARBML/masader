    "Abstract": "Massively multilingual models for neural machine translation (NMT) are theoretically attractive, but often underperform bilingual models and deliver poor zero-shot translations.\nIn this paper, we explore ways to improve\nthem. We argue that multilingual NMT requires stronger modeling capacity to support\nlanguage pairs with varying typological characteristics, and overcome this bottleneck via\nlanguage-specific components and deepening\nNMT architectures. We identify the off-target\ntranslation issue (i.e. translating into a wrong\ntarget language) as the major source of the\ninferior zero-shot performance, and propose\nrandom online backtranslation to enforce the\ntranslation of unseen training language pairs.\nExperiments on OPUS-100 (a novel multilingual dataset with 100 languages) show that\nour approach substantially narrows the performance gap with bilingual models in both oneto-many and many-to-many settings, and improves zero-shot performance by \u223c10 BLEU,\napproaching conventional pivot-based methods",
