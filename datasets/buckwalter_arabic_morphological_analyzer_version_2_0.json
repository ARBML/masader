The lexicons are supplemented by three morphological compatibility tables used for controlling prefix-stem combinations (1648 entries), stem-suffix combinations (1285 entries), and prefix-suffix combinations (598 entries). The actual code for morphology analysis and POS tagging is contained in a Perl script. The documentation consists of a readme file with a description of the lexicon files, the morphological compatibility tables, the morphology analysis algorithm, a summary of stem morphological categories, and a table with the authors Arabic transliteration system.",
