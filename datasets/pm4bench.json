    "Abstract": "Existing multilingual benchmarks for Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) suffer from limitations including language-specific content biases, disjointed multimodal input formats, and a lack of safety evaluation. To address these gaps, we propose PM4Bench, the first Parallel Multilingual Multi-Modal Multi-task Benchmark for LVLMs. PM4Bench features a parallel corpus design across 10 languages, enabling fair and accurate cross-lingual comparisons. It includes the vision setting where text and queries are embedded in images, requiring LVLMs to simultaneously \"see\", \"read\", and \"think\", aligning with real-world applications. Additionally, PM\\textsuperscript{4}Bench incorporates safety evaluations, addressing critical oversight in existing multilingual benchmarks. Using PM4Bench, we evaluate 11 mainstream LVLMs, revealing significant cross-linguistic performance disparities, particularly in vision settings, and identifying OCR capability as a key determinant of these imbalances. We will release PM4Bench at https://github.com/opendatalab/PM4Bench.\n",
