    "Description": "This evaluation kit includes a single Perl script (mteval-v11b.pl) that may be used to produce a translation quality score for one (or more) MT systems. The script works by comparing the system output translation with a set of (expert) reference translations of the same source text. Comparison is based on finding sequences of words in the reference translations that match word sequences in the system output translation. More information on the evaluation algorithm may be obtained from the paper detailing the algorithm: BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation (Papineni et al, 2002).",
