    "Description": "DARES is a dataset for Arabic readability estimation based on Saudi school textbooks. It contains 13,335 instances of text, focusing on the readability levels of different educational levels (grades 1-12). It is organized into two main subtasks: (a) Coarse-grained readability, classifying texts into broad educational levels (elementary, intermediate, high school), and (b) Fine-grained readability, classifying texts into individual grade levels.",

    "Abstract": "The DARES dataset is introduced as a resource for assessing Arabic text readability in the context of Saudi educational materials. It focuses on readability levels across different educational stages (grades 1-12) and consists of coarse-grained and fine-grained tasks. The dataset was used to fine-tune transformer models for readability estimation, demonstrating high performance in classifying educational materials by their readability level.",
