The focus in OPUS\nis to provide freely available data sets in various formats together with basic annotation to be useful for applications in computational\nlinguistics, translation studies and cross-linguistic corpus studies. In this paper, we report about new data sets and their features,\nadditional annotation tools and models provided from the website and essential interfaces and on-line services included in the project.",
