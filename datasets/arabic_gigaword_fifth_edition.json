    "Description": "All text data are presented in SGML form, using a very simple, minimal markup structure. For every opening tag (DOC, HEADLINE, DATELINE, TEXT, P), there is a corresponding closing tag -- always. The attribute values in the DOC tag are always presented within double-quotes the id= attribute of DOC consists of the 7-letter source abbreviation (in CAPS), an underscore character, an 8-digit date string representing the date of the story (YYYYMMDD), a period, and a 4-digit sequence number starting at 0001 for each date (e.g. XIN_ARB_200101.0001) in this way, every DOC in the corpus is uniquely identifiable by the id string.",
