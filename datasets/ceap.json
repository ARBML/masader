    "Abstract": "Persisting in a binary relationship with honor, shame was an important element of the pre-Islamic Arabic social evaluation system. In my\nstudy, I analyzed the two most important EPA concepts parallel to\nEnglish shame \u2013 \u02c1ayb and \u02c1a\u0304r \u2013 applying the Cultural Linguistic approach. Based on the analyses on corpus of Early Arabic poetry and\nClassical Arabic dictionaries, I represented cultural schemata encoding the knowledge shared by pre-Islamic Arabs about those phenomena. The paper presents also metaphoric, metonymic, and image-schematic models, which account for the specifics of associated linguistic\nframes. Moreover, I posit a hypothesis on the existence of a schema\nsubsuming the honor- and shame-dishonor-related schemata in\nform of social evaluation of usefulness, which seems to correspond\nto the historical and linguistic data.",
