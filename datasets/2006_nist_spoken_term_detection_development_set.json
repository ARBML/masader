    "Description": "The development corpus consists of three data genres: broadcast news (BNews), conversational telephone speech (CTS) and conference room meetings (CONFMTG). The broadcast news material was collected in 2001 by LDCs broadcast collection system  from the following sources: ABC (English), China Broadcasting System (Chinese), China Central TV (Chinese), China National Radio (Chinese), China Television System (Chinese), CNN (English), MSNBC/NBC (English), Nile TV (Arabic), Public Radio International (English) and Voice of America (Arabic, Chinese, English). The CTS data was taken from the Switchboard data sets (e.g., Switchboard-2 Phase 1 LDC98S75, Switchboard-2 Phase 2 LDC99S79) and the Fisher corpora (e.g., Fisher English Training Speech Part 1 LDC2004S13), also collected by LDC. The conference room meeting material consists of goal-oriented, small group roundtable meetings and was collected in 2001, 2004 and 2005 by NIST, the International Computer Science Institute (Berkely, California), Carnegie Mellon University (Pittsburgh, PA) and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Blacksburg, VA) as part of the AMI corpus project.",
