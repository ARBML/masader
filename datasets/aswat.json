    "Abstract": "Recent advancements in self-supervised speech-representation learning for automatic speech recognition (ASR) approaches have significantly improved the results on many benchmarks with low-cost data labeling. In this paper, we train two self-supervised frameworks for ASR, namely wav2vec, and data2vec, in which we conduct multiple experiments and analyze their results. Furthermore, we introduce Aswat dataset, which covers multiple genres and features speakers with vocal variety. Aswat contains 732 hours of clean Arabic speech that can be used in the pretraining task for learning latent speech representations, which results in achieving a lower word error rate (WER) in Arabic ASR. We report the baseline results and achieve state-of-the-art WERs of 11.7% and 10.3% on Common Voice (CV) and the second round of Multi-Genre Broadcast (MGB-2) respectively, as a result of including our dataset Aswat.\n",
