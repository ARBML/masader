    "Abstract": "Religious hate speech in the Arabic Twittersphere is a notable problem that requires developing automated tools to detect messages that use inflammatory sectarian language to promote hatred and violence against people on the basis of religious affiliation. Distinguishing hate speech from other profane and vulgar language is quite a challenging task that requires deep linguistic analysis. The richness of the Arabic morphology and the limited available resources for the Arabic language make this task even more challenging. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to address the problem of identifying speech promoting religious hatred in the Arabic Twitter. In this work, we describe how we created the first publicly available Arabic dataset annotated for the task of religious hate speech detection and the first Arabic lexicon consisting of terms commonly found in religious discussions along with scores representing their polarity and strength. We then developed various classification models using lexicon-based, n-gram-based, and deep-learning-based approaches. A detailed comparison of the performance of different models on a completely new unseen dataset is then presented. We find that a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and pre-trained word embeddings can adequately detect religious hate speech with 0.84 Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC).",
