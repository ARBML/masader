    "Description": "The data consists primarily of three Arabic-English lexicon files: prefixes (299 entries), suffixes (618 entries), and stems (82,158 entries representing 38,600 lemmas). The lexicons are supplemented by three morphological compatibility tables used for controlling prefix-stem combinations (1,648 entries), stem-suffix combinations (1,285 entries), and prefix-suffix combinations (598 entries). The actual code for morphology analysis and POS tagging is contained in a Perl script. The documentation consists of a readme file with a description of the lexicon files, the morphological compatibility tables, the morphology analysis algorithm, a summary of stem morphological categories, and a table with the author's Arabic transliteration system.",
