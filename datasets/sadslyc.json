    "Abstract": "This paper presents the Saudi Arabian Dialects Song Lyrics Corpus (SADSLyC), the first dataset featuring song lyrics from the five major Saudi dialects: Najdi (Central Region), Hijazi (Western Region), Shamali (Northern Region), Janoubi (Southern Region), and Shargawi (Eastern Region). The dataset consists of 31,358 sentences, with each sentence representing a self-contained verse in a song, totaling 151,841 words. Additionally, we present a baseline experiment using the SaudiBERT model to classify the fine-grained dialects in the SADSLyC Corpus. The model achieved an overall accuracy of 73% on the test dataset.",
