    "Abstract": "The Arabic language suffers from a great shortage of datasets suitable for training deep learning models, and the existing ones include general non-specialized classifications. In this work, we introduce a new Arabic medical dataset, which includes two thousand medical documents collected from several Arabic medical websites, in addition to the Arab Medical Encyclopedia. The dataset was built for the task of classifying texts and includes 10 classes (Blood, Bone, Cardiovascular, Ear, Endocrine, Eye, Gastrointestinal, Immune, Liver and Nephrological) diseases. Experiments on the dataset were performed by fine-tuning three pre-trained models: BERT from Google, AraBERT that based on BERT with large Arabic corpus, and AraBioNER that based on AraBERT with Arabic medical corpus.",
