    "Abstract": "We present our shared task on text-based emotion detection, covering more than 30 languages from seven distinct language families. These languages are predominantly lowresource and are spoken across various continents. The data instances are multi-labeled with\nsix emotional classes, with additional datasets\nin 11 languages annotated for emotion intensity. Participants were asked to predict labels in\nthree tracks: (a) multilabel emotion detection,\n(b) emotion intensity score detection, and (c)\ncross-lingual emotion detection.\nThe task attracted over 700 participants. We\nreceived final submissions from more than 200\nteams and 93 system description papers. We\nreport baseline results, along with findings on\nthe best-performing systems, the most common approaches, and the most effective methods across different tracks and languages. The\ndatasets for this task are publicly available.",
