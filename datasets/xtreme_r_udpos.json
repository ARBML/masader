    "Abstract": "Machine learning has brought striking ad-\nvances in multilingual natural language pro-\ncessing capabilities over the past year. For ex-\nample, the latest techniques have improved the\nstate-of-the-art performance on the XTREME\nmultilingual benchmark by more than 13\npoints. While a sizeable gap to human-\nlevel performance remains, improvements\nhave been easier to achieve in some tasks\nthan in others. This paper analyzes the cur-\nrent state of cross-lingual transfer learning\nand summarizes some lessons learned. In\norder to catalyze meaningful progress, we\nextend XTREME to XTREME-R, which con-\nsists of an improved set of ten natural lan-\nguage understanding tasks, including challeng-\ning language-agnostic retrieval tasks, and cov-\ners 50 typologically diverse languages. In ad-\ndition, we provide a massively multilingual di-\nagnostic suite (MULTICHECKLIST) and fine-\ngrained multi-dataset evaluation capabilities\nthrough an interactive public leaderboard to\ngain a better understanding of such models",
