    "Abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used to\nstore and access information about entities and\ntheir relationships. Given a query, the task of\nentity retrieval from a KG aims at presenting\na ranked list of entities relevant to the query.\nLately, an increasing number of models for entity retrieval have shown a significant improvement over traditional methods. These models,\nhowever, were developed for English KGs. In\nthis work, we build on one such system, named\nKEWER, to propose SERAG (Semantic Entity Retrieval from Arabic knowledge Graphs).\nLike KEWER, SERAG uses random walks to\ngenerate entity embeddings. DBpedia-Entity\nv2 is considered the standard test collection\nfor entity retrieval. We discuss the challenges\nof using it for non-English languages in general and Arabic in particular. We provide an\nArabic version of this standard collection, and\nuse it to evaluate SERAG. SERAG is shown\nto significantly outperform the popular BM25\nmodel thanks to its multi-hop reasoning.\n",
