    "Abstract": "Egyptian Arabic (EA) NLP resources have mainly focused on Cairene Egyptian Arabic (CEA), leaving sub-dialects like Sa\u2019idi Egyptian Arabic (SEA) underrepresented. This paper introduces the first SEA corpus \u2013 an open-source, 4-million-word literary dataset of a dialect spoken by ~30 million Egyptians. To validate its representation, we analyze SEA-specific linguistic features from dialectal surveys, confirming a higher prevalence in our corpus compared to existing EA datasets. Our findings offer insights into SEA\u2019s orthographic representation in morphology, phonology, and lexicon, incorporating CODA* guidelines for normalization.",
