    "Abstract": "Text-Centric Visual Question Answering (TEC-VQA) in its proper format not\nonly facilitates human-machine interaction in text-centric visual environments but\nalso serves as a de facto gold proxy to evaluate AI models in the domain of textcentric scene understanding. Nonetheless, most existing TEC-VQA benchmarks\nhave focused on high-resource languages like English and Chinese. Despite pioneering works to expand multilingual QA pairs in non-text-centric VQA datasets\nthrough translation engines, the translation-based protocol encounters a substantial\n\u201cvisual-textual misalignment\u201d problem when applied to TEC-VQA. Specifically,\nit prioritizes the text in question-answer pairs while disregarding the visual text\npresent in images. Moreover, it fails to address complexities related to nuanced\nmeaning, contextual distortion, language bias, and question-type diversity. In\nthis work, we tackle multilingual TEC-VQA by introducing MTVQA, the first\nbenchmark featuring high-quality human expert annotations across 9 diverse languages, consisting of 6,778 question-answer pairs across 2,116 images. Further,\nby comprehensively evaluating numerous state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), including GPT-4o, GPT-4V, Claude3, and Gemini, on\nthe MTVQA dataset, it is evident that there is still a large room for performance\nimprovement, underscoring the value of MTVQA. Additionally, we supply multilingual training data within the MTVQA dataset, demonstrating that straightforward\nfine-tuning with this data can substantially enhance multilingual TEC-VQA performance. We aspire that MTVQA will offer the research community fresh insights\nand stimulate further exploration in multilingual visual text comprehension.
