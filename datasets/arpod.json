    "Abstract": "In this paper, we present ArPod, a new Arabic speech\ncorpus made of Arabic audio podcasts. We built this\ndataset, mainly for both speech-based multi-lingual and\nmulti-dialectal identification tasks. It includes two languages: Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and English,\nand four Arabic dialects: Saudi, Egyptian, Lebanese\nand Syrian. A set of supervised classifiers have been\nused: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi Layer\nPerceptron (MLP), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Extratrees and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),\nusing acoustic and spectral features. For both tasks,\nSVM yielded encouraging results and outperformed the\nother classifiers.
