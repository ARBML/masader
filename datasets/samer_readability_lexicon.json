    "Abstract": "We present a large-scale 26,000-lemma leveled readability lexicon for Modern Standard Arabic. The lexicon was manually annotated in\ntriplicate by language professionals from three regions in the Arab world. The annotations show a high degree of agreement; and major\ndifferences were limited to regional variations. Comparing lemma readability levels with their frequencies provided good insights in the\nbenefits and pitfalls of frequency-based readability approaches. The lexicon will be publicly available.",
