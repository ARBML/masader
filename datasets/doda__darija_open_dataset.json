    "Abstract": "Nowadays, we are witnessing an unprecedented growth of IT products and services. Yet, in order for many of these solutions to flourish and be viable in a given society, they need to \u00ab understand \u00bb and be able to communicate to some extent using native languages. However, it turns out that step 0 in any serious engagement with Natural Language Processing (NLP) consists of translating the vocabulary to the widely used and most documented language in this field, namely English.",
