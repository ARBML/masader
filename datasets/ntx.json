    "Abstract": "Temporal and numerical expression under-\nstanding is of great importance in many down-\nstream Natural Language Processing (NLP)\nand Information Retrieval (IR) tasks. How-\never, much previous work covers only a few\nsub-types and focuses only on entity extrac-\ntion, which severely limits the usability of\nidentified mentions. In order for such entities\nto be useful in downstream scenarios, cover-\nage and granularity of sub-types are important;\nand, even more so, providing resolution into\nconcrete values that can be manipulated. Fur-\nthermore, most previous work addresses only\na handful of languages. Here we describe a\nmulti-lingual evaluation dataset - NTX - cov-\nering diverse temporal and numerical expres-\nsions across 14 languages and covering ex-\ntraction, normalization, and resolution. Along\nwith the dataset we provide a robust rule-based\nsystem as a strong baseline for comparisons\nagainst other models to be evaluated in this\ndataset. Data and code will be publicly avail-\nable at https://aka.ms/NTX.",
