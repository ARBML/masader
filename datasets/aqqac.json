    "Abstract": "AQQAC is a collection of approximately 2224 questions and answers about Al-Al-Quran. Each question and answer is annotated with the question ID, question word (particles), chapter number, verse number, question topic, question type, Al-Quran ontology concepts (Alqahtani & Atwell, 2018) and question source. The aim of this corpus is to provide a Question-Answering taxonomy for questions about Al-Quran. Additionally, this corpus might be used as a data set for testing and evaluating Islamic IR systems. The text of Al-Quran questions and answers were extracted from trusted two islamic sources: (1000 Su'al Wa Jawab Fi ALKORAN) was compiled by the famous Islamic scholar Ashur (2001). This book contains 1000 questions and answers about Al-Quran written in the Arabic language. Islam \u2013 Al-Quran and Tafseer is a website about Al-Quran that includes a description and a translation of Al-Quran and the reciting rules, the \u201cTajweed\u201d. Additionally, this website has approximately 1224 questions and answers about Al-Quran in the Arabic language extracted from the Altabari Tafseer. Currently, this dataset contains 1224 annotated question-answers and the missing data that hasn\u2019t been shared is due to copyright concerns.\n\n",
