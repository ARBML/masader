    "Abstract": "This paper describes the acquisition, preparation and properties of a corpus extracted from the official documents of the United Nations (UN). This corpus is available in all 6 official languages of the UN, consisting of around 300 million words per language. We describe the methods we used for crawling, document formatting, and sentence alignment. This corpus also includes a common test set for machine translation. We present the results of a French-Chinese machine translation experiment performed on this corpus.",
