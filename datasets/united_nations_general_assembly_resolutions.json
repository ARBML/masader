    "Abstract": "In this paper we describe a six-ways parallel public-domain corpus consisting of 2100\nUnited Nations General Assembly Resolutions with translations in the six official languages of the United Nations, with an average of around 3 million tokens per language. The corpus is available in a preprocessed, formatting-normalized TMX format with paragraphs aligned across multiple\nlanguages. We describe the background to the\ncorpus and its content, the process of its construction, and some of its interesting properties.",
