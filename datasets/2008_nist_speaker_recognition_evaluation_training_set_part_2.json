    "Description": "The speech data in this release was collected in 2007 by LDC at its  Human Subjects Data Collection Laboratories in Philadelphia and by the International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) at the University of California, Berkeley. This collection was part of the  Mixer 5 project, which was designed to support the development of robust speaker recognition technology by providing carefully collected and audited speech from a large pool of speakers recorded simultaneously across numerous microphones and in different communicative situations and/or in multiple languages. Mixer participants were native English speakers and bilingual English speakers. The telephone speech in this corpus is predominately English, but also includes the above languages. All interview segments are in English. Telephone speech represents approximately 523 hours of the data, and microphone speech represents the other 427 hours.",
