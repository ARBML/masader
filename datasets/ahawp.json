    "Abstract": "This article presents a handwritten Arabic alphabets, words\nand paragraphs dataset (AHAWP). The dataset contains 65\ndifferent Arabic alphabets (with variations on begin, end,\nmiddle and regular alphabets), 10 different Arabic words\n(that encompass all Arabic alphabets) and 3 different para-\ngraphs. The dataset was collected anonymously from 82 dif-\nferent users. Each user was asked to write each alphabet and\nword 10 times. A userid uniquely but anonymously identifies\nthe writer of each alphabet, word and paragraph. In total, the\ndataset consists of 53199 alphabet images, 8144 words im-\nages and 241 paragraphs images. This dataset can be used\nfor multiple purposes. It can be used for optical handwrit-\ning recognition of alphabets and words. It can also be used\nfor writer identification (or verification) of handwritten Ara-\nbic text. It is also possible to evaluate difference in writing\nstyles of isolated alphabets as compared to the same alpha-\nbet written as part of the word or in paragraph by the same\nuser using this dataset. The dataset is publicly available at\nhttps://data.mendeley.com/datasets/2h76672znt/1.",
