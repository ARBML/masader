    "Abstract": "In this paper, we introduce XGLUE, a new\nbenchmark dataset that can be used to train\nlarge-scale cross-lingual pre-trained models\nusing multilingual and bilingual corpora and\nevaluate their performance across a diverse set\nof cross-lingual tasks. Comparing to GLUE\n(Wang et al., 2019), which is labeled in English for natural language understanding tasks\nonly, XGLUE has two main advantages: (1)\nit provides 11 diversified tasks that cover both\nnatural language understanding and generation\nscenarios; (2) for each task, it provides labeled\ndata in multiple languages. We extend a recent cross-lingual pre-trained model Unicoder\n(Huang et al., 2019) to cover both understanding and generation tasks, which is evaluated on\nXGLUE as a strong baseline. We also evaluate the base versions (12-layer) of Multilingual\nBERT, XLM and XLM-R for comparison",
