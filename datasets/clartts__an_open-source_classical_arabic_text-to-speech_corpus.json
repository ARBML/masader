    "Abstract": "We present a Classical Arabic Text-to-Speech (ClArTTS) corpus to facilitate the development of end-to-end TTS systems for the Arabic language. The speech is extracted from a LibriVox audiobook, which is then processed, segmented, and manually transcribed and annotated. The ClArTTS corpus contains about 12 hours of speech from a single male speaker sampled at 40100 Hz. In this paper, we describe the process of corpus creation, details of corpus statistics, and a comparison with existing resources. Furthermore, we develop two TTS systems based on Grad-TTS and Glow-TTS and illustrate the performance of the resulting systems via subjective and objective evaluations.",
