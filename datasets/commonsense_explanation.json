    "Abstract": "Language comprehension and commonsense knowledge validation by machines are challenging tasks that are still under researched and evaluated for Arabic text. In this paper, we present a benchmark Arabic dataset for commonsense explanation. The dataset consists of Arabic sentences that do not make sense along with three choices to select among them the one that explains why the sentence is false. Furthermore, this paper presents baseline results to assist and encourage the future evaluation of research in this field. The dataset is distributed under the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA 4.0 license and can be found on GitHub.",
