    "Description": " The KSAA-RD dataset contains over 58,000 Arabic entries and 63,000 English entries. Each entry consists of a word (lemma), its part of speech, and a gloss (definition). The dataset provides both contextualized word embeddings (from AraELECTRA) and fixed word embeddings (from AraVec\u2019s skip-gram model).",

    "Abstract": "The KSAA-RD shared task involves developing a reverse dictionary system for Arabic, with two subtasks focusing on Arabic-to-Arabic and cross-lingual (English-to-Arabic) reverse dictionary tasks. The dataset includes glosses and word embeddings, and the task aimed to improve word embedding models for reverse dictionary generation. Teams participated to predict the most accurate word embeddings from glosses using neural language models like BERT.",
