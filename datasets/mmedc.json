    "Abstract": "The development of open-source, multilingual medical language models can benefit a wide, linguistically\ndiverse audience from different regions. To promote this domain, we present contributions from the\nfollowing: First, we construct a multilingual medical corpus, containing approximately 25.5B tokens\nencompassing 6 main languages, termed as MMedC, enabling auto-regressive domain adaptation for\ngeneral LLMs; Second, to monitor the development of multilingual medical LLMs, we propose a multilingual\nmedical multi-choice question-answering benchmark with rationale, termed as MMedBench; Third, we\nhave assessed a number of open-source large language models (LLMs) on our benchmark, along with those\nfurther auto-regressive trained on MMedC. Our final model, MMed-Llama 3, with only 8B parameters,\nachieves superior performance compared to all other open-source models on both MMedBench and English\nbenchmarks, even rivaling GPT-4. In conclusion, in this work, We present a large-scale corpus, a benchmark\nand a series of models to support the development of multilingual medical LLMs.",
