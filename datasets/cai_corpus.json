    "Abstract": "This study presents a high-quality parallel corpus of 130 children\u2019s stories translated from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) to Egyptian (Cairo) dialect using neural machine translation. We fine-tuned the AraT5 model and employed Claude for initial translations, achieving improved semantic similarity and BLEU scores. The resulting corpus is made publicly available to support future research in Arabic dialect translation.",
