    "Abstract": "CIDAR is introduced as the first open Arabic instruction-tuning dataset that is culturally aligned by human reviewers. It contains 10,000 instruction-output pairs focused on the Arab region, addressing the biases present in English-dominated datasets. The dataset is derived from ALPAGASUS and curated to reflect Arabic cultural nuances, offering a valuable resource for fine-tuning LLMs to align with Arabic culture."
