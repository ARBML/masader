    "Description": "The TDT5 corpus spans collections from April-September 2003 of English, Chinese, and Arabic news text. A total of 15 distinct news \"sources\" are included (where a \"source\" comprises data from a given news agency in a particular language; when an agency publishes in multiple languages, each language is considered a different \"source\"). In contrast to earlier TDT corpora, TDT5 has no broadcast/audio content, only printed news from wire and web sources.",
