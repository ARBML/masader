    "Abstract": "paper describes the impact of dataset characteristics on the results of Arabic document classification algorithms using TF-IDF representations. The experiments compared different stemmers, different categories and different training set sizes, and found that different dataset characteristics produced widely differing results, in one case attaining a remarkable 99% recall (accuracy). The use of a standard dataset would eliminate this variability and enable researchers to gain comparable knowledge from the published results.",
