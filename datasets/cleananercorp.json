    "Abstract": "Label errors are a common issue in machine learning datasets, particularly for tasks such as Named Entity Recognition.\nSuch label errors might hurt model training, affect evaluation results, and lead to an inaccurate assessment of model\nperformance. In this study, we dived deep into one of the widely adopted Arabic NER benchmark datasets (ANERcorp)\nand found a significant number of annotation errors, missing labels, and inconsistencies. Therefore, in this study, we\nconducted empirical research to understand these errors, correct them and propose a cleaner version of the dataset\nnamed CLEANANERCorp. CLEANANERCorp will serve the research community as a more accurate and consistent\nbenchmark.",
