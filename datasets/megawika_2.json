    "Abstract": "We introduce MegaWika 2, a large, multilingual dataset of Wikipedia articles with their citations and scraped web sources; articles are represented in a rich data structure, and scraped source texts are stored inline with precise character offsets of their citations in the article text. MegaWika 2 is a major upgrade from the original MegaWika, spanning six times as many articles and twice as many fully scraped citations. Both MegaWika and MegaWika 2 support report generation research ; whereas MegaWika also focused on supporting question answering and retrieval applications, MegaWika 2 is designed to support fact checking and analyses across time and language.",
