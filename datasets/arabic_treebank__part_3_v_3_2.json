This release includes all files that were previously made available to the DARPA GALE program community (Arabic Treebank Part 3 - Version 3.1, LDC2008E22). A number of inconsistencies in the 3.1 release data have been corrected here. These include changes to certain POS tags with the resulting tree changes. As a result, additional clitics have been separated, and some previously incorrectly split tokens have now been merged.",
