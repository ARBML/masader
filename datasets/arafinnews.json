    "Abstract": "We introduce AraFinNews, the largest publicly avail-\nable Arabic financial news dataset to date, comprising 212,500\narticle\u2013headline pairs spanning a decade of reporting from 2015\nto 2025. Designed as an Arabic counterpart to major English\nsummarisation corpora such as CNN/DailyMail, AraFinNews\nprovides a realistic benchmark for evaluating domain-specific\nlanguage understanding and generation in financial contexts.\nUsing this resource, we investigate the impact of domain speci-\nficity on abstractive summarisation of Arabic financial texts\nwith large language models (LLMs). In particular, we evalu-\nate transformer-based models\u2014mT5, AraT5, and the domain-\nadapted FinAraT5\u2014to examine how financial-domain pretrain-\ning influences accuracy, numerical reliability, and stylistic align-\nment with professional reporting. Experimental results show\nthat domain-adapted models generate more coherent summaries,\nespecially in their handling of quantitative and entity-centric\ninformation. These findings highlight the importance of domain-\nspecific adaptation for improving narrative fluency in Arabic\nfinancial summarisation. The dataset is freely available for\nnon-commercial research at https://github.com/ArabicNLP-uk/\nAraFinNews",
