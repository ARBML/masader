    "Abstract": "We introduce ArVoice, a multi-speaker Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) speech corpus with diacritized transcriptions, intended for multi-speaker speech synthesis, and can be useful for other tasks such as speech-based diacritic restoration, voice conversion, and deepfake detection. ArVoice comprises: (1) a new professionally recorded set from six voice talents with diverse demographics, (2) a modified subset of the Arabic Speech Corpus; and (3) high-quality synthetic speech from two commercial systems. The complete corpus consists of a total of 83.52 hours of speech across 11 voices; around 10 hours consist of human voices from 7 speakers. We train three open-source TTS and two voice conversion systems to illustrate the use cases of the dataset. The corpus is available for research use.",
