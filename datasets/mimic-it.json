    "Abstract": "High-quality instructions and responses are essential for the zero-shot performance\nof large language models on interactive natural language tasks. For interactive\nvision-language tasks involving intricate visual scenes, a large quantity of diverse and creative instruction-response pairs should be imperative to tune visionlanguage models (VLMs). Nevertheless, the current availability of vision-language\ninstruction-response pairs in terms of quantity, diversity, and creativity remains limited, posing challenges to the generalization of interactive VLMs. Here we present\nMultI-Modal In-Context Instruction Tuning (MIMIC-IT), a dataset comprising\n2.8 million multimodal instruction-response pairs, with 2.2 million unique instructions derived from images and videos. Each pair is accompanied by multi-modal\nin-context information, forming conversational contexts aimed at empowering\nVLMs in perception, reasoning, and planning. The instruction-response collection\nprocess, dubbed as Syphus, is scaled using an automatic annotation pipeline that\ncombines human expertise with GPT\u2019s capabilities. Using the MIMIC-IT dataset,\nwe train a large VLM named Otter. Based on extensive evaluations conducted\non vision-language benchmarks, it has been observed that Otter demonstrates remarkable proficiency in multi-modal perception, reasoning, and in-context learning.\nHuman evaluation reveals it effectively aligns with the user\u2019s intentions. We release\nthe MIMIC-IT dataset, instruction-response collection pipeline, benchmarks, and\nthe Otter model.",
