    "Abstract": "The scarcity of Arabic test collections has long hindered information retrieval (IR) research over the Arabic Web. In this work, we present ArTest, the first large-scale test collection designed for the evaluation of ad-hoc search over the Arabic Web. ArTest uses ArabicWeb16, a collection of around 150M Arabic Web pages as the document collection, and includes 50 topics, 10,529 relevance judgments, and (more importantly) a rationale behind each judgment. To our knowledge, this is also the first IR test collection that includes rationales of primary assessors (i.e., topic developers) for their relevance judgments, exhibiting a useful resource for understanding the relevance phenomena. Finally, ArTest is made publicly-available for the research community.",
