    "Description": "Reward models (RMs) have driven the development of state-of-the-art LLMs today, with unprecedented impact across the globe. However, their performance in multilingual settings still remains understudied. In order to probe reward model behavior on multilingual data, we present M-RewardBench, a benchmark for 23 typologically diverse languages. M-RewardBench contains prompt-chosen-rejected preference triples obtained by curating and translating chat, safety, and reasoning instances from RewardBench (Lambert et al., 2024)",
