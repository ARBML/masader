    "Description": "The lexicon comprises 110,271 entries, distributed over three categories:  - a set of 52,981 common word entries. This set is extracted from a corpus of more than 13 million words distributed over 6 different domains (sports/games, news, finance, culture/entertainment, consumer information, personal communications). This was done with the aim of reaching a target for each domain of at least 95% self coverage. In addition to extracting word lists from the corpus, a list of closed set (function) word classes are included in the final word list.  - a set of 50,135 proper names (including person names, family names, cities, streets, companies and brand names) divided into 3 domains. Multiple word names such as New_York are kept together in all three domains, and they count as one entry. The 3 domains consist of first and last names (9,738 different entries), place names (22,998 different entries), and organisations (17,309 different entries).  - and a list of 7,155 special application words translated from English terms defined by the LC-STAR consortium. This list contains: numbers, letters, abbreviations and specific vocabulary for applications controlled by voice (information retrieval, controlling of consumer devices, etc.).",
