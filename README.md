The first online catalogue for Arabic NLP datasets. This catalogue contains more than 600 datasets with more than 25 metadata annotations for each dataset added by more than 40 contributors. You can view the list of all datasets using the link of the webiste [https://arbml.github.io/masader/](https://arbml.github.io/masader/)

> **Abstract:** The NLP pipeline has evolved dramatically in the last few years. The first step in the pipeline is to find suitable annotated datasets to evaluate the tasks we are trying to solve. Unfortunately, most of the published datasets lack metadata annotations that describe their attributes. Not to mention, the absence of a public catalogue that indexes all the publicly available datasets related to specific regions or languages. When we consider low-resource dialectical languages, for example, this issue becomes more prominent. In this paper we create \textit{Masader}, the largest public catalogue for Arabic NLP datasets, which consists of 200 datasets annotated with 25 attributes. Furthermore, We develop a metadata annotation strategy that could be extended to other languages. We also make remarks and highlight some issues about the current status of Arabic NLP datasets and suggest recommendations to address them.\*

## Access Data

You can access the annoated dataset using `datasets`

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
masader = load_dataset('arbml/masader')
masader['train'][0]
```

which gives the following output

{'Abstract': 'Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) is the official language used in education and media across the Arab world both in writing and formal speech. However, in daily communication several dialects depending on the country, region as well as other social factors, are used. With the emergence of social media, the dialectal amount of data on the Internet have increased and the NLP tools that support MSA are not well-suited to process this data due to the difference between the dialects and MSA. In this paper, we construct the Shami corpus, the first Levantine Dialect Corpus (SDC) covering data from the four dialects spoken in Palestine, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. We also describe rules for pre-processing without affecting the meaning so that it is processable by NLP tools. We choose Dialect Identification as the task to evaluate SDC and compare it with two other corpora. In this respect, experiments are conducted using different parameters based on n-gram models and Naive Bayes classifiers. SDC is larger than the existing corpora in terms of size, words and vocabularies. In addition, we use the performance on the Language Identification task to exemplify the similarities and differences in the individual dialects.',
